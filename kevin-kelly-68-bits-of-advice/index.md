# Kevin Kelly的68条建议


Kevin Kelly 2020年在他68岁生日时给年轻人提的68条建议：

1. Learn how to learn from those who disagree with you or even offend you. See if you can find truth in what they believe.

   接受不同理念的人，并向他们学习。
   
2. Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.

   热情可抵岁月漫长。

3. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary and it prevents you from trying to make it perfect so you have to make it different. Different is much better.

   截止日期很重要，防止拖延症。

4. Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of that same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.

   不耻下问。

5. Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love, keep asking them “Is there more?” until there is no more.

   倾听是对亲人的爱，最好的反馈。

6. A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can't believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.

   如果你不觉得一年前的自己是个“白痴”，那么这一年你什么进步也没。

7. Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.

   学会感恩，这是最好的美德。

8. Treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. It's powerful with old friends and it's a great way to make new friends.

   请客吃饭，拉近朋友之间友谊。

9. Don't trust all-purpose glue.

   不要相信有东西能解决任何事情。

10. Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and will kick-start their imaginations.

   定期给孩子讲故事。

11. Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit or debt that's acceptable is debt to acquire something whose value will increase over time — like a house. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them so don't be in debt to losers.

    购买资产，不要购买负债。

12. Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.

    专业人士只是懂得如何优雅处理问题的业余者。

13. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.

    可证伪的理论或命题，才能成为科学。

14. Don't be the smartest person in the room. Hang out with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.

    多跟聪明人交流，尤其是与你意见不同的聪明人

15. Rule of three in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they have just said, then again, and then once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.

    刨根问底，往祖坟上刨😂

16. Don't be the best. Be the only. 

    不要成为最好的，做回你自己吧。

17. Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they want you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. So go ahead. 

    不要害羞，人们都等着对方介绍自己。

18. Don't take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are just like you — occupied, distracted. Try again later. It's amazing how often a second try works.

    不要为默认拒绝而烦恼，换个地点，换个时间再试一次。

19. The purpose of the habit is to remove that action from self negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it, you just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth to flossing.

    好习惯的养成，就是从简单的事开始做起。

20. Promptness is a sign of respect.

    按时是尊重对方的表现。

21. When you're young, spend at least six months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent to experience what your worst lifestyle may be. That way, when you have something in the future that you want to risk, you won't be afraid of the worst-case scenario.

    吃亏要趁早。

22. Trust me: there is no “them”.

    不要在意“他们”。

23. The more that you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. So to be interesting, be interested.

    想要成为有趣的人，先对周围感兴趣。

24. Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving away too much.

    大方一点无妨，没有一个人在临终前会后悔送出太多东西。

25. To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.

    像成就伟大的事情，没有银弹，唯有手熟尔。

26. The golden rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all the other virtues.

    [golden rule黄金法则](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%81%95%E9%81%93)用中国话来讲就是“己所不欲勿施于人”。   

27. If you're looking for something in your house and then you finally find it, when you're done with it, don't put it back where you found it, put it back where you first looked for it.

    如果你在找某样东西，找到后你不应该把他放在原位，而是放到你第一次找它的地方。

28. Saving money and investing money are good habits. Small amounts of money invested very regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.

    储蓄，定投都是投资的好习惯。

29. To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibilities for the mistakes that you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It's astounding how powerful this ownership is.

    犯错很正常，要勇于承担错误。

30. Never get involved in a land war in Asia.

    不要卷入亚洲领土争端。

31. You can obsess about serving your customers, clients, audiences, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work. But of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you much further.

    取悦你的客户，你将会走的更远。

32. Show up. Keep showing up.  Somebody successful once said ‘99% of success is just showing up.’

    坚持不下牌桌，最终会取胜。

33. Separate the process of creation from improving. You can't write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don't select. While you sketch, don't inspect. While you write the first draft, don't reflect. At the start the creator mind must be unleashed from judgment. 

    创造和改造要分开不能同步进行。

34. If you're not falling down occasionally, you're just coasting.

    这句没看懂😑

35. Perhaps the most counterintuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you'll get. Understanding that is the beginning of wisdom.

    无私一点吧，你给予越多收到的越多。

36. Friends are better than money. Almost anything that money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways, a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.

    拥有朋友比金钱更重要。一方有难，八方支援。

37. This is true: it is hard to cheat an honest man.

    很难欺骗一个诚实的人。

38. When an object is lost, 99% of the time it is hiding within arm's reach of where it was last seen. So, search in all possible locations in that radius and you'll find it.

    找东西好办法，当东西丢失时，99%可能在最后一次看到它的地方。

39. You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.

    你成为什么样的人，不是你想象的，不是你说的，而是你花费时间做的。

40. If you lose or forget to bring a cable and adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels have a drawer full of cables, adapters, and chargers that others have left behind and probably have the one that you want if you can claim it after you borrow it.

    暂时用不到，如果去酒店没带数据线，可以让酒店提供之前客人丢失的数据线拿来一用。

41. Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only affects the hater. So release a grudge as if it was poison.

    仇恨就像是诅咒，它只会影响仇恨的人。

42. There is no limit on better. Talent is unevenly distributed, but there is no limit on how much we can do with what we start with.

    没看懂😑

43. Be prepared. When you are 90% done any large project, like a house, a film, an event, an app, the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.

    机会是留给有准备的人。

44. When you die, you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.

    当你死去，除了你的名誉，你什么也带不走。

45. Before you are old attend as many funerals as you can bear and listen. Nobody talks about the departed's achievements. The only thing people mention is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.

    在你年老之前，尽可能多地参加你能承受的葬礼并倾听。没有人谈及逝者的成就。人们唯一提到的是你在取得成就时是个什么样的人。

未完待续...
