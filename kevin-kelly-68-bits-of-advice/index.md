# Kevin Kelly的68条建议


Kevin Kelly 2020年在他68岁生日时给年轻人提的68条建议：

1. Learn how to learn from those who disagree with you or even offend you. See if you can find truth in what they believe.

   接受不同理念的人，并向他们学习。
   
2. Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.

   热情可抵岁月漫长。

3. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary and it prevents you from trying to make it perfect so you have to make it different. Different is much better.

   截止日期很重要，防止拖延症。

4. Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of that same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.

   不耻下问。

5. Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love, keep asking them “Is there more?” until there is no more.

   倾听是对亲人的爱，最好的反馈。

6. A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can't believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.

   如果你不觉得一年前的自己是个“白痴”，那么这一年你什么进步也没。

7. Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.

   学会感恩，这是最好的美德。

8. Treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. It's powerful with old friends and it's a great way to make new friends.

   请客吃饭，拉近朋友之间友谊。

9. Don't trust all-purpose glue.

   不要相信有东西能解决任何事情。

10. Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and will kick-start their imaginations.

   定期给孩子讲故事。
