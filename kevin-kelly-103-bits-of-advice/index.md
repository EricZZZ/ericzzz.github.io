# Kevin Kelly的103条建议


之前写过一篇[Kevin Kelly的68条建议](https://miasanmia.cc/kevin-kelly-68-bits-of-advice/)，这不今年老爷子70岁生日，又来推荐人生建议了😀。

1. About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.

   大约99%的时间里，最好的时间就是现在。

2. No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.

   没有人像你一样对你的财产印象深刻。

3. Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.

   永远不要为你不想成为的人工作。

4. Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.

   培养12个爱你的人，他们的价值远远大于1200万喜欢你的人。

5. Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.

   不要犯同样的错误，试着犯新的错。

6. If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.

   如果你停下来听一个音乐家或街头艺人表演超过一分钟，你就欠他们一美元。

7. Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.

   你在说“但是”之前任何话都不算数。

8. When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

   当你原谅某人，他们可能没有注意到，但是你将会治愈。原谅不是为别人做的事儿，这是自己给自己的礼物🎁。

9. Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.

   礼貌是不需要花钱的。

10. Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.

    双方有争执，找第三方。

11. Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.

    效率被高估了，偷懒被低估了。（劳逸结合）

12. When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.

    当你领导时，你的工作时创造更多的领导者，而不是更多的追随者。

13. Criticize in private, praise in public.

    私下批评，公开表扬。

14. Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

    先活下来，再考虑生命的意义。

15. It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.

    学生有义务向老师索取一切，老师有义务向学生传授一切。

16. If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.

    如果想要赢得重要的比赛，改变规则使它变得更有趣，改变规则使它变成新的游戏。

17. Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.

    向资助者要钱，他们会给你建议；但向别人要建议，他们会给你钱。

18. Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.

    生产力往往会让人分心。不要以更好的方式尽快完成你的任务为目标，而是以你永远不想停止做的更好的任务为目标。

19. Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.

    立即向供应商、工人、承包商支付你所欠的款项。他们下次会不遗余力地先与你合作。

20. The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.”

    最大的谎言“我不需要写下它，我能记住。”（ps.好记性不如烂笔头）
