# Kevin Kelly的103条建议


之前写过一篇[Kevin Kelly的68条建议](https://miasanmia.cc/kevin-kelly-68-bits-of-advice/)，这不今年老爷子70岁生日，又来推荐人生建议了😀。

   没有人像你一样对你的财产印象深刻。

3. Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.

   永远不要为你不想成为的人工作。

4. Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.

6. If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.

   如果你停下来听一个音乐家或街头艺人表演超过一分钟，你就欠他们一美元。

7. Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.

   你在说“但是”之前任何话都不算数。

8. When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

   当你原谅某人，他们可能没有注意到，但是你将会治愈。原谅不是为别人做的事儿，这是自己给自己的礼物🎁。

9. Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.

   礼貌是不需要花钱的。

10. Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.

    双方有争执，找第三方。

11. Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.

    效率被高估了，偷懒被低估了。（劳逸结合）

12. When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.

    当你领导时，你的工作时创造更多的领导者，而不是更多的追随者。

13. Criticize in private, praise in public.

    私下批评，公开表扬。

14. Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

    先活下来，再考虑生命的意义。

15. It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.

    学生有义务向老师索取一切，老师有义务向学生传授一切。

16. If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.

17. Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.

    向资助者要钱，他们会给你建议；但向别人要建议，他们会给你钱。

18. Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.

    生产力往往会让人分心。不要以更好的方式尽快完成你的任务为目标，而是以你永远不想停止做的更好的任务为目标。

23. Handy measure: the distance between your fingertips of your outstretched arms at shoulder level is your height.

    方便的测量方法：你伸出的手臂指尖与肩同高的距离就是你的身高。

24. The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.

    你所做的努力（锻炼、陪伴、工作）的一致性比数量更重要。没有什么比每天做的小事更重要，这比你偶尔做的事要重要得多。

25. Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.

    艺术创作不是自私的。

26. Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let her tell you if she is.

    不要问女人她有没有怀孕，让她告诉你。

27. Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.

    你需要三样东西。有能力不放弃某样东西直到它成功，有能力放弃不起作用的东西，以及信任其他人来帮助你区分这两者。

28. When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.

    问问你钦佩的人。他们的幸运发生在远离主要目标的弯道上。所以要拥抱弯路。生活对任何人来说都不是一条直线。

    通过提升好的行为而不是惩罚坏的行为，你会得到10倍的效果，特别是在儿童和动物身上。

33. Spend as much time crafting the subject line of an email as the message itself because the subject line is often the only thing people read.

    花同样多的时间来设计电子邮件的主题行，因为主题行往往是人们阅读的唯一内容。

34. Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.

    不要等待暴风雨过去，在雨中舞蹈。

35. When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.

    在检查求职者的推荐信时，雇主可能不愿意或禁止说任何负面的东西，所以留下或发送一个信息说："如果你强烈推荐这个求职者是超级棒的，请给我回信。" 如果他们不回复，就当做是一种否定。

    使用密码管理器，更安全，更容易，更好。

37. Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.

    受教育的一半技能是学习你可以忽视的东西。

38. The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.

    荒谬的雄心勃勃的目标的好处是，它设定了非常高的标准，所以即使是失败，也可能是以普通人的眼光来衡量的成功。

39. A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.

    了解自己的一个好方法是认真反思你觉得别人令人讨厌的一切。

40. Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.

    在酒店房间里，把你所有的东西都放在看得见的地方，不要放在抽屉里，并且都集中到一个地方。这样你就不会落下任何东西。如果你需要把充电器之类的东西放在一边，就在它旁边放几件其他的大件物品，因为你留下三件物品的可能性比只留下一件更小。
